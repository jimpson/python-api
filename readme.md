## Demo Python Web API

This repository is a demo web API project. The main code inspiration was from this tutorial https://blog.teclado.com/first-rest-api-flask-postgresql-python/. After working through the tutorial, I made an attempt to move the code to using Flask-SqlAlchemy as 
the ORM for the application.
